title: "(Draft) Calendar for Fall 2020"
---

Our first class meeting will be held via Zoom from 1:00 to 2:15 PM on Tuesday 2020-08-25.

Class sessions are scheduled for Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 to 2:15 PM. All course materials will be delivered remotely using the Zoom platform. We anticipate there will wind up being a total of **24** regular lectures given across the 27 class sessions listed below. As the semester approaches, we'll change the calendar to reflect additional information and more finalized plans.

All class sessions will be recorded and made available to students enrolled in the class.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(knitr); library(janitor); library(lubridate); library(tidyverse)
cal_data <- read_csv("cal_data.csv")
cal_data <- cal_data %>% 
    mutate(Date = excel_numeric_to_date(Date))
kable(cal_data)
```

Final Presentations will be held in December, prior to the end of University Final Exams on 2020-12-16.
